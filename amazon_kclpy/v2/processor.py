        Called by a KCLProcess instance to indicate that this record processor should shutdown. After this is called,
        there will be no more calls to any other methods of this record processor.

        As part of the shutdown process you must inspect :attr:`amazon_kclpy.messages.ShutdownInput.reason` to
        determine the steps to take.

            * Shutdown Reason ZOMBIE:
                **ATTEMPTING TO CHECKPOINT ONCE A LEASE IS LOST WILL FAIL**

                A record processor will be shutdown if it loses its lease.  In this case the KCL will terminate the
                record processor.  It is not possible to checkpoint once a record processor has lost its lease.
            * Shutdown Reason TERMINATE:
                **THE RECORD PROCESSOR MUST CHECKPOINT OR THE KCL WILL BE UNABLE TO PROGRESS**

                A record processor will be shutdown once it reaches the end of a shard.  A shard ending indicates that
                it has been either split into multiple shards or merged with another shard.  To begin processing the new
                shard(s) it's required that a final checkpoint occurs.
