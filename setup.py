#
# If a user runs the basic install:
#
#     python setup.py install
#
# They will be notified of any jars that are downloaded for this package. Those jars
# will go in amazon_kclpy/jars so that they can be installed as part of this package's
# data.
#
#     python setup.py download_jars
#
# Will retrieve the configured jars from maven and then advise the user
# to rerun the install command.
